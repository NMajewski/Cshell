# UNIX Shell Clone in C

A UNIX Shell clone written in C, complete with a Makefile and documentation.

## Getting Started

After downloading the package, unzip and run the Makefile (type "make" in your terminal/shell). Executables will be "executor" which opens the shell. The shell supports most Linux commands like "cd", "pwd", "ls", and so on. It also supports I/O piping, conjunction operators ("command_1 && command_2"), and a subshell which runs commands in a separate shell (wrap desired subshell command in parenthesis like so: "(command)").

### Installation Prerequisites

* Access to a shell / terminal

### Installation

In the main directory, run ```make all```in terminal

```
$ cd shell dir/
$ make all
$ sh3ll
```
To rebuild the project, run ```make clean``` to remove the build

## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks after running the sh3ll executable:

```
$ pwd
$ Second example
$ And keep this in mind
```
